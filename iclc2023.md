    Ziffers is an algorithmic number based musical notation system offering a terse syntax for the improvisation and composition of complex melodies and rhythms. Ziffers gradually evolved from empirical experiments aiming at closing the gap between several number-based notational practices spanning from numerical and staff notation to pitch class set and post-tonal theories. Ziffers places a special emphasis on providing support for live algorithmic and generative composition, embedding a toolset of algorithmic processes directly in its syntax model. The system also tries to accommodate these fixed media types of notation to the liveness experienced when using live coding environments. Ziffers has been influenced by TidalCycles (McLean and Geraint, 2010) and Ixi Lang (Magnusson 2011), two popular live coding libraries designed around the use of a custom domain specific language, called mininotation, allowing the live manipulation and transformation of musical patterns.
    In this article, we propose an environment agnostic presentation of the Ziffers musical notation system. As a proof of concept, this article also introduces two implementations running in different environments: Sonic Pi (Aaron, 2016), a live coding platform designed for education and music performance and Musescore, a general purpose scorewriter and score playback software. In doing so, we are hoping to highlight the versatility of our approach, which seems to allow the use of a unified syntax for different contexts of execution and interpretation.

# INTRODUCTION: ZIFFERS, QUICKLY EDITABLE NUMBER BASED NOTATION

**Ziffers** — named and inspired by the older Ziffersystem [@warkentin2022story] — proposes a system focused on the conciseness and expressiveness of musical notation. Ziffers is designed to enable generation and transformation of musical patterns [@mccormack1996grammar;@mclean2020algorithmic] in minimal amounts of time and typing. To do so, Ziffers uses a text-based syntax for representing various short-hand symbolic notations used in music theory and concepts in programming languages. The need for concise and succinct notation in the context of live coding performance is a well-known constraint (Roberts and Wakefield, 2018) that gave rise to many practices and techniques aiming to reduce frictions in the conversational feedback loop between the musician and its programming interface (REFERENCE). Domain specific languages (DSLs) and the use of terse mini notations have become an important design pattern in the conception of live coding interfaces (Hoogland 2019; ADD OTHER), and can also be noted to be a key concept in the larger realm of exploratory or conversational open-ended programming where reactivity and fast decision-making is of prime importance to achieve a creative state of flow [@nash2015cognitive]. MISSING (Beth Kery & Myers 2018 REFERENCE?)

Ziffers is designed as a terse and platform independent syntax capable of embedding algorithmic and generative processes at the notational level.  Basic notation tokens denoting pitch, rhythm or expression marks form the base notation, enriched by a set of generative operators and tokens denoting algorithmic transformations of that first layer of notation. Implementation of the Ziffers system is specific to each targeted platform, in conformity with the notation described in this article and the documentation for the prototype implementation. The first prototype of Ziffers has been created in 2018 [@Ziffers_2018] as an inline parser for Sonic Pi. It was thought as an attempt to speed up the process of writing melodic lines on-the-fly, taking advantage of the large number of predefined methods and compositional helpers offered by Sonic Pi's rich internal library. Its design aimed at resolving the dissociation between pitch and rhythm imposed by Sonic Pi data structure and imperative-oriented programming model. After a few years of evolutionary prototyping, Ziffers 2.0 was released in 2022 [@Ziffers_2022], including a new parser aiming at extending Ziffers capabilities with new operators, nested structures and better support for stochastic and aleatoric composition.

# METHOD: DESIGNING BY DRAWING FROM MUSIC NOTATION HISTORY

The Ziffers music notation project initially started as an experiment to confront historical numeric pitch-based music notation practices with the kairotic notations [@cocker2013live] typically found in live coding and algorithmic music performance systems [@blackwell2022live]. Therefore, the system has been designed iteratively in conversation with the diverse and complex historical legacy of said practices. Documents pertaining to the systems of numeric pitch notation in common practice can be traced back as early as the European baroque up to the contemporan era through examples as varied as the American Nashville system, the Chinese Jianpu simplified notation [@kaminski2022jianpu;@MNMA_2022] or the theoretical pitch-class set numbering of musical structures and chords used in post-tonal music theory [@forte1973structure]. 

## Running pandoc {#pandoc}

Pandoc is software which turns text written in markdown into a
beautiful looking document, complete with references. You will need to
run it to create PDF documents of your paper for checking and
uploading for peer review.

You may download pandoc for all major operating systems (including MS
Windows, Apple Mac OS and GNU/Linux) from the following website:
[http://pandoc.org](http://pandoc.org)

As an alternative to the above downloads, on OS X only, the homebrew
package manager can be used to install pandoc: [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)

If you use homebrew to install on OS X you will need to install the pandoc package as follows:
```
brew update
brew install pandoc
```

To produce PDF files you will need to have LaTeX installed, as well as
pandoc. See the pandoc website for installation instructions:
[http://pandoc.org/installing.html](http://pandoc.org/installing.html). LaTeX
is used internally, you will not have to edit any LaTeX documents.

To render your markdown source as HTML, open a terminal window, change
into the folder where the template is and run the following command:

~~~~ {.bash}
pandoc --template=pandoc/iclc.html --citeproc --number-sections iclc2023.md -o iclc2023.html
~~~~

To produce a PDF document, make sure you have LaTeX installed (see
above), and run the following:

~~~~ {.bash}
pandoc --template=pandoc/iclc.latex --citeproc --number-sections --latex-engine=xelatex iclc2023.md -o iclc2023.pdf 
~~~~

For a higher quality output, add the option `--latex-engine=xelatex`
to the above. You will need the [Inconsolata](http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) and [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=91&L=1) opentype fonts installed.

An example Makefile is also provided to run these commands for you. If you have *make* installed, you can use it to build the pdf files.

## Bibliographic references

Pandoc accepts bibliographic databases in a range of formats, so make
sure you have the right extension on your file.

Table: Supported bibliography formats with file extension.

Authors may be referenced in two ways; inline, e.g. @Schwitters32
wrote the Ursonate sound poem, or in parenthesis, e.g. Ursonate is a
sound poem [@Schwitters32]. Multiple references should be grouped
together like so [@Schwitters32;@Miller56;@Greenewalt46].

The pandoc command given in the [above section](#pandoc) will automatically
render your references according to Chicago author-date style.

At the head of the markdown source file for this template, you will see an entry
for "bibliography" that points to the file references.bib. Here you'll find
examples of bibliography entries in BibLaTex format, including examples for
articles, books, book chapters and items from conference proceedings.

## Code

We have chosen a single column layout to better support code examples
without having to break lines. The following shows how to include a
code example with syntax highlighting:

~~~~ {.haskell}
d1 $ every 3 (iter 4) $ brak $ "bd [sn [[sn bd] sn]]*1/3"
~~~~
